"""To build a themed quiz application from scratch, you can follow these steps:

    Create a new Flask project using your preferred method, e.g. using a cookiecutter template.
    Create the database using SQLAlchemy to store user information and quiz results.
    Implement the user registration and login functionality using Flask-Login.
    Fetch the quiz questions from Open Trivia Database API.
    Create a page to display the quiz questions to the user and allow them to select answers.
    Store the user's quiz results in the database and calculate their scores based on correct answers.
    Create a page to display the rankings of all users who have taken the quiz, and make it publicly accessible.
    Optionally, create an API endpoint to access the rankings in JSON format.

This should provide a basic framework for the quiz application. You can further customize and improve it by adding
more features, such as themes for the quizzes, levels of difficulty, etc."""
